Digital Image Forgery and Tampering Detection

This project detects manipulated digital images using deep learning and frequency-domain analysis. 
The system classifies images as authentic or tampered by learning spatial and frequency inconsistencies 
introduced during image manipulation.

Datasets used: CASIA v2, IMD2020, MICC-F220
